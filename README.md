# Deep-Learning
It contains different projects that I will make while learning Deep Learning

**Deep Learning** is a class of Machine Learning algorithms. Machine Learning is a field of Computer Science when a computer is given the
ability to learn and make decisions. An algorithm is trained on a huge data having input parameters and output variable corresponsing to 
those input parameters. The algorithm learns with the help of this data and when any new input data comes which the algorithm has not
seen before, it takes the decision and returns the output variable. 

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning which is inspired from how our brain is structured and functions.
